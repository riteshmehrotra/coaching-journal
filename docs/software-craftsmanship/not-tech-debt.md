# Not Techincal debt.. that's irresponsible software development


*"Yeah, we know we have technical debt. We have added a dedicated epic in our backlog for quality related items and will pick as soon as we have some bandwidth from business deliverables"* 

Be it the lack of automated testing, code maintainability issues or team's inability to continuously integrate and deliver. "We will do it later" -  is a common response I get to hear often.



## Some popular "buts", and why they don't make sense
 
### But, we just started this as a PoC for this new platform/technology

Why shouldn't a techical evalution involve how quality will be handled?
  
### But, we take care of quality post development

Quality later delays customer's right to delivery by leaving potential bugs to be discovered later and its a disservice to the investers.
### But, our focus is delivery right now, we will improve design later

Substandard code that makes maintainance harder

### But, we inherited this legacy codebase
