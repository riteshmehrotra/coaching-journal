# Postponing quality is not Techincal debt. its's irresponsible software development


*"We know we have technical debt. We have added quality related items in our backlog and will pick as soon as we have some bandwidth"* 

I have heard this numerous times. Be it the lack of automated unit tests, legacy code slowing down development or inability to continuously integrate and deliver.



## Some popular reasons, and why they don't make sense
 
### But we are just doing a PoC
<>
### We take care of quality post development

Quality later delays customer's right to delivery by leaving potential bugs to be discovered later and its a disservice to the investers.
### Our focus is delivery right now, we will improve design later

Substandard code that makes maintainance harder
