Hi, I am Ritesh Mehrotra.

I coach and mentor software development teams on software design, architecture and best practices for agile software development with customer centricity as primary focus.

I am a keen contributor on agile transformation initiatives. I help teams in my wider organization with their agile transformation journey, which includes workshops on Scrum, Kanban to DevOps and development practices inclusive of TDD, pair programming and refactoring.

I am a strong follower of XP development practices, which inspire me to be a disciplined contributor. The quest of continuous and collaborative learning, led me to create a knowledge sharing platform in form of a meetup group named TechTalks (https://www.meetup.com/techtalkssg/). Apart from being a rich knowledge sharing platform, TechTalks serves as a networking ground for entrepreneurs, professionals and tech enthusiasts to meet and exchange ideas.
